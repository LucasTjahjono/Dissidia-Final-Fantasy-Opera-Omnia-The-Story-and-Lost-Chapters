        <h1>The Story and Lost Chapters</h1>

        <h2>Act 1</h2>

        <p>Act 1 of DFFOO focuses on closing the torsions in Materia and Spirtus's world. If the torsions aren't closed then all worlds will be destroyed. Mog the Moogle helps Materia gather Warriors with the Light to close all of them. Act 1 are for beginners because the Chapters gradually get stronger.</p>

        <h2>Act 2</h2>

        <p>Act 2 of DFFOO focuses on getting their memories back because Materia took their bad memories because she thought it would be bad for them. Act 2 also intorduces more villians, like Caius, Kam'lanaut, Eald'narche, Golbez, and Ardyn. Act 2 is mostly for advanced people because the beginning of the Chapters are easy, but the last battles are very hard.</p>

        <h2>Lost Chapters</h2>

        <p>Lost Chapters focuses on one character and does battles revolving around them. A character gets a Lost Chapter a 8-10 months after they have a event. Lost Chapters are simply mini chapters for one single character. The game wants you to play as that character in that Lost Chapter because they are boosted, and you get certain rewards for beating them with the character. In the Lost Chapter, on the 3rd and 4th boss battle you get their respective armor and on the 5th boss battle you can get their respective 15 CP weapon, or you can get the weapon for clearing the Lost Chapter.</p>

        <h2>Required Lost Chapters</h2>

        <p>Required Lost Chapters are specific to only Act 1, as you need to get the character, though you don't need to finish the Lost Chapter to get the character. Most of the times, you just need to beat a Quest LV 10 Boss Battle, which you should be able to beat since you should be about level 35 by the time you have to get the characters. But sometimes after the Quest LV 10 Boss Battles you have to do a couple more battles.</p>
